# Location Trivia Delegates - Swift

## Goals

1. Replace access to a shared data manager with a delegate protocol.
2. Create and use a custom delegate protocol.
3. Compare different means of communicating between view controllers.


## Review

We've seen Location Trivia in many guises at this point. Most recently, we added the ability for users to create new locations with their own trivia. To do this, we used a singleton data store instance to avoid the difficult problem of passing data back from a view controller to its presenter.

In this lab, we will accomplish this feat by giving the Add Location view controller a delegate.


## Discussion

Think about the Add Location VC for a minute. Conceptually, what is its role? It is a UI for creating a new location, right? That is -- the Add Location VC is some object that, through some series of actions undertaken by the user, creates a new Location object.

We can analogize the role of this VC to that of a method -- it takes in no particular "arguments" and "returns" a Location.

Our goal is to model that behavior with a delegate.


## Analogs

Apple is fond of using delegation for this exact circumstance in its own classes. The Cocoa frameworks have a few examples of view controllers that conceptually result in the creation (or selection) of a particular object. For example, see:

* [`MPMediaPickerController`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MediaPlayer/Reference/MPMediaPickerController_ClassReference/) -- a UI for selecting music or video from the user's library. Via [`MPMediaPickerControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MediaPlayer/Reference/MPMediaPickerControllerDelegate_ProtocolReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008216), it returns the selected item(s).
* [`ABPeoplePickerNavigationController`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AddressBookUI/Reference/ABPeoplePickerNavigationController_Class/) -- a UI for selecting people from the user's address book. It returns the selected contact(s) via [`ABPeoplePickerNavigationControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AddressBookUI/Reference/ABPeoplePickerNavigationControllerDelegate_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/ABPeoplePickerNavigationControllerDelegate).
* Many more examples... `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`, `GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate`, etc.

## Instructions

1. First, create two view controllers -- a `UITableViewController` with the locations (`LocationsTableViewController`), and a simple `UIViewController` for adding new locations (`AddLocationViewController`). In Interface Builder, drag a `UITableViewController` and a `UIViewController` onto the storyboard and set each view controller to the custom classes we just created. Make sure to embed the `LocationsTableViewController` in a navigation controller. Drag a `UIBarButtonItem` onto the navigation bar of the `LocationsTableViewController`, set its system item to "Add", and create a segue leading from the button to the `AddLocationsViewController`. Drag a `UITextField` and two `UIBarButtonItem`s (one cancel button and one submit button) onto the `AddLocationViewController` and wire them up to the `AddLocationViewController.swift` file appropriately.

	Note that there is no shared data store in this project.

1. Create a custom protocol for the delegate of the `AddLocationViewController` class. Name it `AddLocationViewControllerDelegate`. Make sure to include the `class` keyword after the protocol declaration (i.e. `protocol AddLocationViewControllerDelegate: class` . This indicates that the protocol we just created can only be adopted by classes (not structs or enums) - we do this is for memory management reasons that we'll discuss later. It should have three required functions:
    * A function that alerts the delegate that the user has tapped 'Cancel' on the `AddLocationViewController`.
    * A function that asks the delegate if the submitted location name is valid. This function should enforce that there are no duplicate location names.
    * A function that alerts the delegate that the user has confirmed their new location name.
    
    Think about what you would name these functions for a bit. Naming delegate protocol functions is a tricky business -- it's usually best to follow Apple's lead where possible. Check out [their documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerControllerDelegate_Protocol/#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIImagePickerControllerDelegate/imagePickerController:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:) on `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`. 
    
	Since our `LocationsTableViewController` adopts the `AddLocationViewControllerDelegate` protocol, it could potentially be the delegate for multiple different `AddLocationViewControllers`s.  Due to this, these delegate protocol functions would each ideally take at least one argument - an argument for the sender (in this case, an `AddLocationViewController`. The latter two functions should also take the submitted location name as an argument. Based on these recommendations and Apple's naming standards, I'd recommend these names for the functions above:
    
    * `func addLocationViewControllerDidCancel(viewController: AddLocationViewController)`
    
    * `func addLocationViewController(viewController: AddLocationViewController, shouldAllowLocationNamed name: String) -> Bool`
    
    * `func addLocationViewController(viewController: AddLocationViewController, didAddLocationNamed name: String)`

2. Add a `weak` property of type `AddLocationViewControllerDelegate` to `AddLocationViewController` called `delegate`. For memory management reasons that we won't get into here, delegate properties should almost always be `weak`.

3. Have `AddLocationViewController` call the functions on the delegate when appropriate:
    * When the user types in the text field, you should check to see whether the entered name is valid. If it is invalid, disable the save button (but re-enable it if the entered name becomes valid). Remember: wire the "Editing Changed" event of the text field to an action method to run some code whenever the text of a field changes.
    * If the user hits the "Cancel" or "Save" buttons, call the appropriate delegate functions.

    Note that it is standard for a view controller like this to **not** dismiss itself upon completion -- rather, that is the responsibility of the delegate. A view controller cannot know for certain *how* it was presented (i.e., modally or pushed onto a navigation stack), so it is best to leave the details of that up to the presenting view controller (in this case, `LocationsTableViewController`. Follow that convention in `AddLocationViewController` by not having it call any `dismiss...` or `pop...` methods.

4. Make `LocationsTableViewController` conform to your new delegate protocol. This will involve implementing all three functions of the protocol, as well as marking the class as conforming to the protocol. The preferred style is actually not to make the class itself adopt the protocol - instead, create an extension on `LocationsTableViewController` and have that extension adopt the protocol. You should then implement all of the delegate protocol functions within the extension.

    The `... shouldAllowLocationNamed:` function should return `true` only if the location name is unique. The `... didAddLocationNamed:` function should create a new `Location` object and add it to `LocationsTableViewController`'s array of locations. Both the `...didAddLocationNamed:` and `...didCancel:` functions should dismiss the `AddLocationViewController`.

5. Now we need to make our `LocationsViewController` the delegate of any new `FISAddLocationViewController` instances! Wire that up in `prepareForSegue`.

6. Bask in the glory of your reusable view controller!


## Advanced

Make the `... shouldAllowLocationNamed:` delegate function optional (defaulting to `YES`). Make sure your code doesn't crash if the delegate doesn't implement this method (that is the whole point of being optional)!

Make the keyboard pop up automatically in the name field when `AddLocationViewController` appears.

Make the return button on the keyboard do the right thing in the `AddLocationViewController`.

Though it would be a little weird, try pushing the Add Location VC onto a navigation stack, rather than presenting it modally. Think about what needs to change in your delegate implementation. But, you shouldn't have to change any code in the Add Location VC itself.
